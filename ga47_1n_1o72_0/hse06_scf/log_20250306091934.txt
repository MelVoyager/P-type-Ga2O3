|     You have a (more or less) 'small supercell' and for smaller cells       |
|     it is recommended to use the reciprocal-space projection scheme!        |
|     The real-space optimization is not efficient for small cells and it     |
|     is also less accurate ...                                               |
|     Therefore, set LREAL=.FALSE. in the INCAR file.                         |

|     The real-space projection scheme for the treatment of the non-local     |
|     pseudopotentials has been switched on but on file POTCAR I have not     |
|     found any entries, signalling me that you have never performed a        |
|     real-space optimization of all non-local projectors! BE WARNED that     |
|     a calculation using the real-space projection scheme together with      |
|     non-local projectors which were not real-space optimized (according     |
|     to the plane-wave cutoff used in this calculation) might give more      |
|     or less inaccurate results. I hope you know what you are doing.         |
